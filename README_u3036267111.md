# Huffmencoder

#Time complexity analysis: 
  Here we treat n as number of characters in the text. Since we must read through every characters, the reading part takes $\theta$(n). The following part we need another parameter p which is the number of different characters there is in the text, and p <= n. The tree construction uses $\theta$(p) time because when constructing the tree, each loop we delete two element then add one element to the heap map, so after each loop we have p-1 as new numbers of element, and since each loop takes $\theta$(log(p)) time due to the operations for maintaining the heapmap , we have $\theta$(p*log(p)) time complexity here. The file outputing of code.txt needs $\theta$(p) time while encodemsg.txt need $\theta$(n) time for obvious reasons. 

Overall : $\theta$(n+p*log(p))
Notice worst case is p=n, so worst case time = $\theta$(n^2*log(n))

#Space complexity analysis:
  some variables we declared:
    - chdict: $\theta$(p)
    - node_heap: $\theta$(p)
    - The tree structure: $\theta$(p)
    - writing part: $\theta$(1)

The overall space required is $\theta$(p), but if including the output content, it is $\theta$(p+n)
Worst case $\theta$(n)

#Use of AI:
  I used AI for making the command line part since I have never encountered that requirement and had zero idea what that means so I asked AI about it. (I always just call the function in the program file and it will run itself). My first program was extremely time and space consuming and so I searched online for the data structure that is best to implement huffmencode, I found that its heap,(we havent learnt that yet) and so I watched some youtube while asking AI when learning it, and it gives me some information on heapq import in python with some default functions it comes with. Other than that, I didn't use it for my own code.
