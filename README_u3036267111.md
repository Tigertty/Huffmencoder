Time complexity anaylysis: 
  Here we treat n as number of characters in the text. Since we must read through every characters, the reading part takes (n). The following part we need another parameter p which is the number of different characters there is in the text, and p <= n. The tree construction uses (p) time because when constructing the tree, each loop we delete two element then add one element to the heap map, so after each loop we have p-1 as new numbers of element, and since each loop takes (log(p)) time due to the operations for maintaining the heapmap , we have $\theta$(p*log(p)) time complexity here. The file outputing of code.txt needs (p) time while encodemsg.txt need (n) time for obvious reason. 

Overall : n+p*log(p)
